    <string name="info">\nWhen you get a call from an unknown number, have you ever wondered whether it is the same number that you got a call from yesterday or last week? \nWhether it is the number which you didn’t bother to save?
\n\nThen congratulations, you have already installed the solution. And you can exit the app now. \nWhen you are receiving a call, a note will be displayed informing you whether the caller has ever called you and if so how much time before. 
\n\nCaller information is taken from your phone call log.
\n\nAnd you can add a custom note of your choice to be displayed with the last-called-time. \n\nAll unknown numbers will be saved within the app itself. So you don’t have to worry if you accidentally delete entries in your phone call log. 
\n\nThese services are invoked only when you are receiving a call. So this will not drain your battery. \n\nYou can turn on/off app components individually.</string>
    <string name="about">\nYour feedback is much appreciated. \nThanks.</string>
